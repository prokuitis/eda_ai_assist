## 📖 What is eda_ai_assist?

eda_ai_assist, also called "Ash," is a tool that makes it easier to work with electronic design automation (EDA) files. It works with your existing command line interface (CLI) or shell. Ash adds a layer of artificial intelligence (AI) that helps you analyze and understand complex EDA files faster. This means less time hunting for information and more time getting your work done.

You don’t need to be a programmer to use it. If you know how to open a terminal window and run a command, you can use eda_ai_assist. Ash acts like a smart helper inside your shell. It listens to your commands and offers AI-powered insights wherever you need them.
